# Machine Learning Specialization - Coursera


![](/resources/Certification.png)

This repository contains my coursework and projects completed during the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction/?utm_medium=coursera&utm_source=home-page&utm_campaign=mlslaunch2022IN) offered by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online. 

The specialization is designed to provide a solid foundation in machine learning and equip learners with the skills to build real-world AI applications.

<hr/>

## Applied Project
- Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.
- Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression.
- Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification.
- Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world.
- Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees.
- Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning, including clustering and anomaly detection.
- Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.
- Build a deep reinforcement learning model.
